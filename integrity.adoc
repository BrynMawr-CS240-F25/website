== Academic Integrity

At Bryn Mawr, we assume students are trustworthy and work with honesty and
integrity.

for information about Bryn Mawr's Honor Code.]. Midterms and the final will be 
closed book. Lab coding challenges will be open-book and closed-internet. 
Thus, you cannot use VS Code, internet browsers, and other programming aids.  
However, you can use the text book, _Dive into Systems_, the Linux Programming 
Manual (available with `man`), and your class notes. You may work with others and 
with online materials for assignments, but you will be expected to explain and reproduce your 
submitted assignment on your own.
