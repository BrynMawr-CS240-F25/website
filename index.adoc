image::microcomputing-80s.jpg[width=400px]

This course studies the hierarchical design of modern digital
computers. Combinatorial and sequential logic elements; construction of
microprocessors; instruction sets; assembly language programming, compilers, 
and concepts of basic operating systems. Lectures cover
the theoretical aspects of machine architecture. In laboratories, students will 
work hands-on with hardware. Over the semester, students will implement a virtual 
machine in C.
